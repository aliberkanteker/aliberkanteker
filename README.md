# Hello, I'm Ali Berkant Eker ðŸ‘‹

I am a master's student in Astronomy and Space Sciences at Erciyes University. I conduct research on embedded systems, telemetry, and satellite technologies, and I develop various projects in these fields.

I have been serving as the team captain of the KAYSat Model Satellite Team for over 3 years. During this period:

* I took on System Engineering.
* I managed project planning and technical processes.
* I handled team coordination and task distribution.
* I was in charge of Landing Systems, Satellite modeling, Integration, and design processes.

In my work, I specifically focus on satellite technologies, embedded system design, and telemetry infrastructures.
